Step 1. Download Illinois PDL from the official website in xlsx format
Step 2. Rename the .xlsx file to IL.xlsx
Step 3. Put the xlsx file in IL folder and run the code named IL.py
Step 4. Make sure Column D(Status) of the output IL_PDL.csv file contains only these values: PREFERRED, NON_PREFERRED, PREFERRED_WITH_PA.
        If it contains different values, this indicates that the actual PDL had varying statuses at the same time. Please verify manually.
