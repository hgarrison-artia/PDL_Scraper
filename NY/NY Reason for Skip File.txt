New York's PDL is created with Microsoft Word for Microsoft 365. This pdf file can be converted into different formats, including .docx and .xlsx through Adobe Desktop App. 
No intuitive delimeters between drugs. Sometimes they will be delimited by \n characters and others they will just be next to each other delimited by spaces. Need to find a better way to export the PDL.
