Idaho's PDL is created with Microsoft Word for Microsoft 365 and the authorâ€™s name is not available. This pdf file can be converted into different formats, including .docx and .xlsx through Adobe Desktop App. 
The converted Word document puts every Preferred/Non-Preferred drug in a class in one cell, so it doesn't seem to be code-able.
The converted Excel document also puts Preferred/Non-Preferred drug in one cell, with the exception of highlighted cells, and the PDL is splitted into multiple sheets with seemingly irregular pattern.
