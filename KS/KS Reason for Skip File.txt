Kansas's PDL is created with Microsoft Word for Microsoft 365 by Nicole Ellermeier. This pdf file can be converted into different formats, including .docx and .xlsx through Adobe Desktop App. 
The Word version places all drugs in a class into one cell, with no pattern i.e. '\n' or '\t'
The Excel version merges multiple columns and also puts everything in one cell, so it seems difficult to code.
